In Interval problems,
1 - Sorting by start time helps you know when a meeting begins.
2 - Sorting by end time helps you know when a room is freed.


G - Merge Intervals:
------------------------
- Need to sort the intervals start element in Ascending order to make the interval ranges inline.
- if current intervals start interval is > previous intervals end interval, then there is no overlapping, just add
  current interval to result.
- if not get the maximum from previous intervals end interval and current intervals end interval, change the previous
  intervals end intervals
- previous element has already been added to result so it will update interval in its reference


When to use start and end in intervals problems and why ??

1. N meetings in room uses end
2. Erase overlapping uses end
3. Merge interval, Insert interval use start
