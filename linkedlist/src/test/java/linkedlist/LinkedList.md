#####  02 - Adding two numbers
```text
    You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse
    order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

    You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

    Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
    Output: [7,0,8]
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

    Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
    Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
    example: 
    9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> null
    9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> null
    8 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> null
```
